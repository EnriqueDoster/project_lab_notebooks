    * DNA extraction, library prep
    * 16S sequencing
    * Taxonomic classification with qiime2
  * Resistome
    * DNA extraction, library prep
    * targeted resistome sequencing
    * Resistome classification with AMR++ and MEGARes v2
  * Bioinformatic analyis
    * Count normalization
    * Count aggregation
    * Ordination and ANOSIM
    * Alpha diversity and wilcox
    * Differential abundance with ZIG model
* Results
  * Sequencing results
  * Resistome results
  * Microbiome results
* Discussion
  * total ADD has a relatively small effect on resistome composition
  * greater variation in individual animal resistomes. resistome converges toward similar resistomes later in the feeding period
    * Opposite in individual microbiomes
