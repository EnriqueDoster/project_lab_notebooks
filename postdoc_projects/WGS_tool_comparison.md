Creating Mannheimia haemolytica sequencing baits
------------

"The overall goal of this project is to support an accurate, reproducible, transparent and uniform approach to whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis for purposes of outbreak detection and pathogen surveillance. The overarching objective is to demonstrate how different analytic approaches to whole-genome sequence analysis can impact analysis results. Supporting objectives are to evaluate the impacts of 1) dataset, 2) core- vs. pan-genome inclusion, and 3) genome comparison approach (i.e., using SNPs, k-mers, gene-by-gene alleles, or functional domains)."

### 2019-5-5

* Troubleshooting the download of SRA data and metadata
* Attempted a python script to parse SRA metadata and sent Meera some example files, but still need to troubleshoot duplicate rows.
